### Preliminary visualizations of data
* Print outs
  * Head
    * This gave us a good idea of how each column contains when we were deciding whether to drop or merge them
  * Data types
    * We saw that the data had mostly numbers (one float and the rest were int), but there were several categorical/non-numerical variables such as name, release_date, detailed_description, about_the_game, short_description, reviews, header_image, website, support_url, support_email, windows, mac, linux, metacritic_url, notes, supported_languages, full_audio_languages, packages, etc.
  * Nulls
    * We were able to find the sum of null values for each column in order to better gauge what columns we should be dropping or filling
* Dataset Insights
  * Average Playtime by Price
    * This graph aims to explore whether there's a relationship between how much a game costs and how long people actually play it. The idea is to understand if higher priced games offer more value in terms of playtime, or if cheaper or free games still manage to keep users engaged for long periods. We might consider adding weight to playtime when recommending a game.
  * Platform Support
    * We wanted to find how important the platform support is. It was surprising as we found that 100% of games supported Windows, but only 18.4% for Mac and 13.3% for Linux. This means it could be important to consider what platform the user has, so we can make relevant recommendations.
* Feature Correlation heatmaps
  * We split up our features into 3 graphs: Genres, Categories, and ‚ÄúThe Rest‚Äù
  * These correlation heatmaps let us know which features we should be merging. Features with high correlations with each other should be merged as one
  * Genres
    * The majority of the genres seem to be independent of each other
    * However, we still have some genres such as Documentary & Short, Episodic & 360 Video, Movie & 360 Video, Violent & Gore, etc showing high correlation. All of these make sense as to why they are so highly correlated
  * Game Categories
    * The majority of game categories seem to also be independent of each other
    * However, like the genres, we still have some game categories such as Remote Play on Phone & Remote Play on Tablet, Shared Split Screen vs Remote Play Together, Online Pvp & Pvp. All of these also make sense as to why they are so highly correlated
  * ‚ÄúThe Rest‚Äù of the features
    * These are the features from our dataset that we did not one hot encode
    * There seems to be a bit of correlation between many of the last features, but otherwise mostly independent (i.e Recommendations & num_review, num_review & peak_count)





### Detailed description of data processing done so far
* Dropping Null/Empty values
  * There were unnamed games in our dataset, we saw that these were most likely mistakes or test/development games. So we dropped the null values in names because we thought it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to train the model on these unnamed games and have it recommend unnamed games.
Dropping Columns
  * We dropped columns that we deemed irrelevant or in a non numerical format  in which we could not use or were linearly dependent.
  * The list of features dropped includes
'name','tags','reviews', 'appid', 'detailed_description', 'about_the_game', 'short_description', 'header_image', 'website', 'support_url','support_email','metacritic_url','notes', 'packages', 'developers', 'publishers','screenshots', 'movies','user_score','score_rank','estimated_owners','positive','negative'
* One Hot Encoding
  * For string features such as genre, categories and supported languages we implemented one hot encoding. 
  * We first obtained a list of every single unique value for each column utilizing a set. 
  * After then we turned each unique value into its own corresponding column where for each game, 1 indicated that the game contained the specific genre category or language and 0 indicates the game did not.


### Detailed description of data modeling methods used so far
* Features chosen
  * We realized that our 300 features was a bit too many for the model, so we had to tone it down a bit
  * The majority of these features were created from the one hot encoding of string features, so for now we just got rid of the features we believe wouldn‚Äôt impact the clusterings too much (i.e supported_languages & audio_languages)
  * This successfully dropped our features to around 90
  * However, clustering based on 90 features still felt like a lot, so we decided to create multiple clusters based on the features
* Finding the right K for each clustering
  * We utilized the ‚Äúelbow method‚Äù as discussed from lecture, where the optimal K is found through iterating over several values of k (in our case we did 1 - 20) until there was a low inertia AND a low number of clusters
  * Based on this, we found that around k=16 worked the best for genres, k=5 for pricing, and k=5 for peak concurrent users
* Kmeans++
  * We utilized the sci-kit learn library in order to initialize the k centroids and keep moving them until they converged. For each cluster, we used Kmeans++
* Silhouette score
  * Also from sci-kit learn library, we were able to easily calculate the silhouette scores of our clusterings based on their average distance to other points in its cluster and average distance to points in their nearest neighbor cluster


### Preliminary results
* Silhouette score evaluation
  * According to the silhouette scores of 0.32, 0.03, 0.01 that we measured after clustering, our clustering seems to be okay/not too good, but with a lot of room for improvement
  * We plan on improving this score through more feature engineering during the preprocessing part (i.e haven‚Äôt merged features with high correlation yet)
* Data pattern from cluster visualization
  * Genre cluster
    * These clusters offered lots of insights into what genres are typically paired with each others
    * For example, typically games that have genres of Indie, Action, and Adventure go well with each other
    * Another example, typically games that have genres of Indie and Casual go well with each other
  * This would then be a factor we can use to properly recommend a user a related game
* Pricing distribution cluster
  * These clusters tell us the distribution of the pricing for the games
  * When recommending similar games, we can take into consideration whether the new game is inside the pricing cluster of the games the user has previously played
  * Although we realize that this feature alone isn‚Äôt the best, we will make sure to reduce its weight when recommending a game
* Peak concurrent users cluster
  * These clusters group the games based on their concurrent user count, which can be another feature to consider when recommending a game. Someone who likes to play popular games might also like other similar popular games

**Semantic Text-Based Clustering**
* Sentence Transformer
  * We used a transformer model to embed the ‚Äúabout_the_game‚Äù text field for each game
  * Tried this instead of TFIDF to try grouping games based on the semantic meanings of descriptions rather than by the individual words used in the descriptions
  * Transformed each description into a vector, added the length of the description as a normalized feature
* Clusters
  * After generating the sentence embeddings, we ran KMeans clustering to get clusters based on how the games describe themselves
  * We then sampled games from each cluster to interpret their themes
* Preliminary Conclusions
  * Clusters captured narrative-heavy single-player games, competitive multiplayer shooters, casual/co-op games, anime and niche indies, and more.
  * The cluster content differed from genre or tag clusters, offering a new perspective on how to group and recommend games.
  * Games with similar tone or gameplay feel, even with different tags, ended up in the same cluster.


# Project Proposal
**Description of the project**
- New Game+ : A web app that helps gamers find new steam games based on their profile.
- Use steam dataset and api to recommend steam games to a user based on their past games played (factoring in hours played and perhaps user limitations/preferences)
- **Reach goals**:
    - Produce a list of recommended games based on the users‚Äô owned games and play times
      
**What data needs to be collected and how you will collect it?**
- We will need to collect data for clustering related games with each other in order to recommend similar ones, we can use this existing datasets on kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data) 

**How you plan on modeling the data?** 
- We plan on using a Kmeans++ model in order to cluster common games with each other

**How do you plan on visualizing the data?.**
- We plan creating a heatmap of the features in order to show cluster relationships

**What is your test plan?**
- We can use silhouette scores to measure how well our clusters are
- We create the clusters using the model, and then verify our model by running through 50-100 manual tests to make sure we get recommended a game that makes sense

## Running the Code

This project includes a **Next.js frontend** and a **Django backend** using **Pipenv** for the backend environment.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bvogler10/CS506_FinalProject.git
cd CS506_FinalProject
```

### Step 2: Backend (Django)
Open a terminal window
```bash
cd new-game-plus-backend
```

Activate Pipenv and install dependencies
```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root backend directory (new-game-plus-backend/.env)

To use the Steam API, you‚Äôll need a personal API key.

You can get it here:
üëâ https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

 - Login or create a Steam account.
 - Fill in any required domain name (e.g., localhost is fine for local development).
 - Click "Register" and copy your key.

Once you have your key, add it to your .env file like this:

Add the following line:
```
STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key
```

Start the Django server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server should now be running at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Step 3: Frontend (Next.js)
Open a new terminal window
```bash
cd new-game-plus-frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
