4000,Garry's Mod,2006-11-29,0,5.99,0,"Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties. We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: it’s all free. Please note: Some multiplayer servers and game-modes might require you to own other games - such as Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2. ","Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties.

Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil. From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Choose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&amp;D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background.

Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Gather your party. Take the adventure online as a party of up to four. Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength.

Kennedy, Jill Valentine. OVERVIEW About the Game Death Is Not an Escape. Trapped forever in a realm of eldritch evil where even death is not an escape, four determined Survivors face a bloodthirsty Killer in a vicious game of nerve and wits. Pick a side and step into a world of tension and terror with horror gaming's best asymmetrical multiplayer. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog. WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns. These persons, or even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy, may experience epileptic symptoms or seizures while playing video games. If you or any of your relatives has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing any video game. IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult a physician if you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, disorientation, or convulsions. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. You may reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.

346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,2017-08-27,0,14.99,15,"ARK: Survival Ascended! Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! ARK: Genesis Part Two! Your quest for ultimate survival is now complete with the launch of ARK: Genesis Part 2! Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you! Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a ‘Shadowmane’ Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called ‘HLN-A’ who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker. About the Game As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

218620,PAYDAY 2,2013-08-13,18,9.99,78,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. ","PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.

Hero is a game where you the player go on quests in a world with 3 kingdoms. You must unite all 3 kingdoms to defeat a dark enemy that has been unleashed upon your world.

Think of Witcher 2. Semi open world with linear gameplay. 2). Combat: Fight orcs and dragons throughout the game. We use a simple hack and slash combat system that focuses on precision of attacks rather than button mashing. 3). Dialogue: Throughout the story you will be conversing with many NPC's and the choices you make in those conversations will affect things. Those things might happen immediately at the end of a quest you're on or will be way later in the game where the consequence of your actions will be shown.","Welcome to Hero!

843900,Demon's Rise - War for the Deep,2018-04-29,0,6.99,0,"Enter the depths of the ancient city of Angor and prepare for battle. Form a mercenary party of adventurers, sell swords, rogue sorcerers and assassins and enlist with an army of Dwarves trying to retake their ancient homeland. Fight in a brutal campaign against goblins, undead, ratmen and the demon lords they worship. Demon's Rise is a turn-based tactical game where players must lead a party of six heroes through the bowels of an underground city. Battles are intense affairs where the proper use of terrain and cover is as important as the choice of spell or attack. BATTLES: Fight through 85 grueling levels ... a 35 level linked campaign and 50 patrol missions. CHARACTERS: Choose a band of six heroes from 30 playable character classes. Each class has unique strengths, weaknesses and special abilities. REWARDS: Uncover the treasures of the old kingdom ... find gold or thousands of possible weapons, pieces of armour and artifacts. Equip them to make your heroes stronger or sell them off and buy something more fitting. EXPERIENCE: As your heroes fight, they gain experience, level up and unlock powerful new spells and abilities. COVER / TERRAIN: Position is key to victory. Place your heroes behind cover for protection or next to a magical shrine for extra power. MORALE: Your heroes and their enemies may panic when they see the battle go badly or enter a berserker fury if they see an ally cut down. Form a tight battle line where your stronger heroes can lend courage to the weaker ones and use intimidation as a weapon against your foes. ABILITIES: Wizards can launch fireballs, cast protective wards or summon powerful monsters to their aid. Illusionists can trick their enemies into switching sides or make them panic without reason. Mighty warriors can make powerful weapon strikes, become berserk or heal themselves during battle. All 30 player classes and many of the enemies you will encounter can perform such abilities and can use them to turn defeat into victory. Demon's Rise - War for the Deep is a traditional game with NO IN-APP PURCHASES or unfair 'pay to win' mechanics. Victory is earned through courage, strength and tactics and not additional spending.","Enter the depths of the ancient city of Angor and prepare for battle.

Early versions of the game caught my friends attention so I took it seriously and decided to publish it. It has an art style that revolves around the infamous cube and a difficulty that will have you smashing your keyboard in 30 minutes. Flow Parkour comes in two game modes, the normal version and the endless version. The normal version, which has around 30 levels on release, is the original game mode. Your target is to make it to the finish of the obstacle course as quick as possible without dying. (getting hit by a turret, falling in a trap...) In most levels you have access to your weapons, sometimes you only have one of the weapons. It depends on the level. Each level has its own difficulty with a given target. Endless is a game mode with a score, you need to rank up the highest score possible while lasting as long as possible with no weapons but a grappler. You need to cross a large map just to collect around a 100 points without dying every time... Flow parkour has 5 difficulties : Easy - A short or simple level Moderate - A short level that has little to no obstacles (such as turrets) Difficult - A longer level that has a bit more obstacles Very difficult - A level with a very hefty amount of buffed turrets or any other obstacles Extreme - A very long and complex level with buffed turrets with a ridiculous amount of obstacles that makes it nearly impossible to finish So what are you waiting for ?

From the creators of TIME's Game of the Year 2014, '80 Days', comes the final instalment in the acclaimed Steve Jackson's Sorcery! series. An interactive story told through thousands of choices, all of which are remembered, where no two adventures are the same.

Adapted and expanded from the million-selling gamebook series by legendary game designer Steve Jackson, co-founder of Lionhead Studios (with Peter Molyneux) and co-creator of Fighting Fantasy and Games Workshop (with Ian Livingstone).

Could a hypnosis device I accidentally found on the bus be my chance to making my dreams come true? “Carry these boxes up, hurry!” “These boxes are as heavy as lead and you want me to carry them all up to the 7th floor by myself without a lift?” I was working as a humble security guard in a hospital and was being ordered around by an unreasonable female boss. In my anger, I used this dark power for the first time. “Good, you have satisfied your master. Now you need to remember my orders.” “Make sure you choose the best women carefully, I’m very picky.” After this first taste of sweet victory, I started planning my own harem. The arrogant female doctor, the gentle big-sister-type nurse, the cute girlfriend-type nurse, the strict teacher-type nurse, and the weak MILF... were all in my grasp. “This hypnotic device is clearly not a magical spell. I’m pretty certain it’s a technological product.” “Whether or not the person who made this had a greater purpose in mind, it's mine now.” But will such power be completely free of side effects? Will I be able to enjoy all the benefits of my desires and get away with it, or will I be punished, paying a price for the power and losing everything? ◆Gameplay Instructions A POV first-person visual novel. The player takes on the role of the male protagonist, who accidentally acquires a hypnosis device and looks for the right targets to hypnotize in his daily life and in his job as a hospital security guard. This is all in order to fulfill his dreams of his own harem. After using the “hypnosis device” for the first time, you are free to plan your actions every day and choose which storylines and female characters you want to explore. Available targets include: the Arrogant female doctor, the gentle big-sister-type nurse, the cute girlfriend-type nurse, the strict teacher-type nurse, and the weak MILF. Hesitation, recklessness, and excessive greed can all cost you damage or put you in unexpected danger, so you should be extra cautious when faced with a choice. The “hypnosis device” is your greatest helper. However, the more powerful it is, the more carefully it must be used. Whether you end up fulfilling your “harem dream” or losing everything depends on whether you have made the right choices. ◆Game Features ◇18 basic CGs, including more than 200 differentials ◇Game text: 80,000 ◇Five main female characters ◇Game endings: 2 types (including a bad ending and a good ending of the harem dream) ◆Featured system 　◇Full CG mode can be turned on in the gameplay environment setting, allowing you to browse HCGs freely. 　◇Stress-free operation--fast text skipping system","◆Story “Out of my way, fuck off!” “If I had a chance, if only I had some extraordinary power…” Newly unemployed, I was daydreaming of a harem while walking down the street, when an arrogant hottie in a luxury car interrupted me. Could a hypnosis device I accidentally found on the bus be my chance to making my dreams come true? “Carry these boxes up, hurry!” “These boxes are as heavy as lead and you want me to carry them all up to the 7th floor by myself without a lift?” I was working as a humble security guard in a hospital and was being ordered around by an unreasonable female boss.

It's idle when you like and active when you want. Like any base-builder, you get to make the big decisions while taking control of your own laser shooting, resource-collecting character whose only objective is repairing their broken ship and getting off the dark and dreary rock onto which they've crashed.

Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen, including a radar, log and build menu. A playable character which you can level up allowing you to jump into the action whenever you want. Mystical, weather and lighting effects that are a delight for the eyes. A fully circular planet: keep walking one way and you'll arrive back home. A high-power active mode where resources are plentiful but so are the enemies, and a low-power idle mode for when your attention is elsewhere.. THE GAME From nothing but the ruins of your ship: construct the infrastructure to escape the planet and build a truly massive base. Construct a range of facilities (factories, research labs, alien technology, mystical crops) and watch as storage creatures and aliens take up residence around your base. Wander away from the safety of your base to find resources and crashed resource pods. Research strange creatures and use them to create new and powerful resources. Construct droids, level them up, give them new skills, and take them out into the dark to collect resources, and destroy the dangerous blood hives that are attracted to your industry.

Bloodrayne Betrayal: Fresh Bites distills the best parts of the BloodRayne series into a bloody, twitchy, action-packed 2D hack ‘n slash adventure through fifteen challenging stages. The Brimstone Society has summoned Rayne for one last mission to lead a group of soldiers into a giant underground castle to do battle against none other than her own father, Kagan. When the soldiers prove ineffective against Kagan’s supernatural menaces, it’s up to Rayne to run, jump, cut, and feed her way through gruesome foes, deadly traps, tricky platforming sections, and horrifying bosses. It’s Rayne’s last job — will she “clean house” or find herself six feet under? All-new A-List voice acting: Original BloodRayne cast members Laura Bailey and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Rayne and Kagan, alongside other talented voice actors who bring new life to the original written dialog. Higher resolution character sprites, and support for HD displays (up to 4K) help make Fresh Bites the definitive Bloodrayne Betrayal experience. New difficulty options: Play with a newly rebalanced difficulty tuned for a fun and engaging experience, or sink your teeth into the punishing original difficulty mode if you’re looking for a tough-as-nails challenge.

823420,Erinye Demo,2018-04-07,0,0.0,0,"Erinye is a PC adventure game with some RPG tints, where you explore a 2D world, full of dungeons, castles, mazes, towns, secrtets, puzzles, treasures and different enemies to fight, swinging weapons, magic or other trinkets you will find on your way. Story The story begins when our heroine, Erin, arrives to the town of Azuliris, following the trail of a mysterious witch who, rumors say, carries a very valuable treasure with her. Things get difficult when in Azuliris, Erin meets the ShyGirls, a group of bandits who have taken control over the town, blocking all the exits and locking the local police force, 'The Eyes', in the station cells. If Erin wants to find the witch, she will have to get rid of the ShyGirls and free Azuliris. But she doesn't know her journey is just begining and a new adventure awaits her, along with the strangest and wicked characters she have ever met. The Characters Erin: A weirdo who refuses to kill her foes, so she goes around doing weird stuff like cutitng their clothes off or crippling them for life. She thinks she doesn't have enemies, only potential friends. Erin fears stupid things like rainbows and butterflies. She love videogames, but really sucks at them. Rina: A greedy little thing who would betray her mother for the right price (if she had a mother). Erin and Rina agree to find together the witch's treasure, but they end up involved in a much bigger deal. At the end of their journey, she may find that the real treasure, is friendship... pfffff! of course she doesn't! Most people asumes she's a fairy, a sprite or an imp, but the truth is unkown. Star: Erin's adoptive sister, she's also her 'best friend'. Her usefulness doesn't go beyond letting Erin save the game every time she calls by phone. She hides her insecurities by wearing provocative clothes. Star loves animals, specially kittens. Like Erin, Star is a videogames fan, her favorite franchise is 'Acid Princess Durazno'. ShyGirls: While they call themselves bounty hunters, the truth is, they are just a bunch of good for nothing bandits who go around looking for the ultimate treasure. Their attire comes from a misinterpretation of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. If you want to know more characters, better play the game. You don't want me to spoil everything here for you.","Erinye is a PC adventure game with some RPG tints, where you explore a 2D world, full of dungeons, castles, mazes, towns, secrtets, puzzles, treasures and different enemies to fight, swinging weapons, magic or other trinkets you will find on your way.

If Erin wants to find the witch, she will have to get rid of the ShyGirls and free Azuliris. But she doesn't know her journey is just begining and a new adventure awaits her, along with the strangest and wicked characters she have ever met. The Characters Erin: A weirdo who refuses to kill her foes, so she goes around doing weird stuff like cutitng their clothes off or crippling them for life. She thinks she doesn't have enemies, only potential friends. Erin fears stupid things like rainbows and butterflies. She love videogames, but really sucks at them. Rina: A greedy little thing who would betray her mother for the right price (if she had a mother). Erin and Rina agree to find together the witch's treasure, but they end up involved in a much bigger deal. At the end of their journey, she may find that the real treasure, is friendship... pfffff! of course she doesn't! Most people asumes she's a fairy, a sprite or an imp, but the truth is unkown. Star: Erin's adoptive sister, she's also her 'best friend'. Her usefulness doesn't go beyond letting Erin save the game every time she calls by phone. She hides her insecurities by wearing provocative clothes. Star loves animals, specially kittens. Like Erin, Star is a videogames fan, her favorite franchise is 'Acid Princess Durazno'. ShyGirls: While they call themselves bounty hunters, the truth is, they are just a bunch of good for nothing bandits who go around looking for the ultimate treasure. Their attire comes from a misinterpretation of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. If you want to know more characters, better play the game. You don't want me to spoil everything here for you.","Erin arrives the town of Azuliris, following the path of a mysterous witch, who is rumored, carries with her a very valuable treasure.

To kick things off, the super cool folks at DrinkBox Studios gave us permission to create Juan Aguate , the star of Guacamelee! Subscribe to Juan to add him to your character roster in the game. We're really excited to see what content the community will come up with. About the Game Based on a true story, Western Press is the most historically accurate frontier dueling game available for PC and Mac. Probably. Competing in tournaments of up to 16 players (or bots), duelists both online and off will face each other in rapid fire, 1v1 sprints to finally settle who can press a random string of ten buttons the fastest. Features No Time to Explain Learning to play is incredibly simple: Buttons go top to bottom, do them fast. A duel takes seconds, and a 16 player tournament takes minutes. So just how good is your guest list’s controller knowledge, and just how fast are their reactions? Submit your answer in ten buttons or less. (Not less, you'll lose. Do ten.) As Easy as A, B, Square, Triangle Custom settings allow you to control which buttons are used, so combos are as complicated as you’d like them to be, from directions only to the full gamut. Western Press features prompts for Xbox controllers, PlayStation controllers, dance mats, and supports a large range of third party controllers. Of course, who could forget our friends on keyboards... Not My Type Keyboarding cow-folk can expertly type their opponent to death. With a choice between ten letter words, random gibberish, or our not-trademarked 'Controller, Replicated ' layouts, discover which best suits your style, select it, and [W] [ I ] [N]! (They're letters. From the keyboard.) Online and Local Tournaments for Humans and Machines Alike Hold custom tournaments for from two to 16 competitors with any mix of local players, online players and bots. The tournament system works out all the match-ups for you, so you get to just sit back and relax. Until it’s your turn. Then stop relaxing because it’s time for extreme and relentless stress. A Test of Character Create a profile and play through the Skill Tester to earn your rank, while simultaneously unlocking some of Western Press’ wild bunch. You start with four playable characters, but you’ll have to earn the other 12 by playing the game. Is there anyone fast enough to unlock Wyatt Hurt? Stroll Down Memory Lane Fancy yourself more intellect than athlete? Try Memory Mode , where players must memorise and repeat an ever increasing string of buttons. But make more mistakes than your opponent, and you eat lead. Steam Workshop Support Create custom characters and environments with your own animations, sounds and taunts. Then share them with the community via Steam Workshop, where they’ll be downloaded dynamically at the beginning of an online tournament!

Enter the kingdom of Egatlea, face terrible Nari enemies, move and jump between floors and obstacles, and do your best to restore peace for your kingdom. In the ancient kingdom of Egatlea, the Felyn lived in peace under the protection of Kathsa, the feline deity. To invoke her in case of danger, Kathsa had given five gems to each of the five cities of the kingdom: Kathse, Macska, Qattus, Catlantis, and Cathenas. These gems symbolized unity and mutual dependence between cities. However, one day, the Nari, inhabitants of the vast ocean that surrounded the kingdom, emerged with a powerful army and surprised the Felyn, usurping the temples of the five cities and seizing the five gems. With the loss of the gems, the cities were in danger of being wholly conquered. The deity Kathsa chose the protagonist, Katto, as the bearer destined to recover the gems and restore peace to the kingdom. Even though the gems' protectors had fallen prisoner to the Nari, Katto demonstrated skill by infiltrating the temples, fighting off the invaders, and recovering the stolen gems. Now, with the five gems in the hands of the Nari, Katto must fight to recover them and gather them in the ancient amulet to summon Kathsa and receive her help to expel the invading Nari and restore peace to the kingdom of Egatlea. Embark on an epic adventure through Catlantis! In this fast-paced 3D platformer, you must jump across gaps, dash past obstacles, scale walls with agile climbs, and defeat enemies by stomping or dashing into them. Navigate through winding corridors and bustling marketplaces, using your skills to overcome obstacles and enemies. Jump over pits, dash through hazards, and climb walls to reach new heights. Defeat enemies by carefully timing your jumps and dashes, landing on them with precision. Explore the richly detailed environments.

2508400,Mothers and Daughters,2024-01-02,0,7.99,0,"In Mothers and Daughters, you play as Max—an 18-year-old college freshman venturing into adult life. All the mothers are true MILF's, as in they are all mothers, and they are all love interests in the game. You can chase that hot MILF neighbor, sexy teacher, your best friend's mom, your arch nemesis' mom, or any of the other mothers in the game. (Pictured Maria and Teri) Similarly, all the daughters you meet are love interests, and you can chase any of them, from the shy girl, the loud mouth, your old babysitter, your best friend's sister, your arch nemesis' sister, or any of the other daughters who are either the same age or slightly older than Max. (Pictured Kimberley your best friend's sister, and Patricia your arch nemesis' sister) At the start of the game, you can choose the name, either staying with Max or customizing it to something else. This is also when you'll set the difficulty of the game. The difficulty setting doesn’t change the content you see in the game, just your journey. The difficulty choice is designed to give the player a challenge or an easier path through the story. The complexities of pursuing multiple women will be more demanding in Hard mode than in Easy mode. In Easy mode, characters are more forgiving and have lower thresholds for Affinity and Persona. Where there is a scene selection, you’ll get to play more scenes in Easy mode. For instance, on the second playable day at the mall, you have multiple choices of which girls to interact with. On Easy mode, you can select all the options. On Hard mode, you need to be more selective, as while you get the same choices, you can choose only a certain number. The Easy mode also allows the enabling of the in-game walkthrough hints. These hints appear under the various choices and show how they will alter the character statistics. These hints are not available in Normal and Hard modes. The difficulty mode also affects some of the apps on the smartphone. With the Easy mode revealing more information than Normal or Hard. There are fourteen mothers you can romance in the game. Amanda, Barbara, Cynthia, Jacquelyn, Jennifer, Katia, Lauren, Margaret, Maria, Meghan, Talia, Teri, Victoria, and Zoe. Each has their own personality, desires, and differing relationships with their daughters. How you approach their daughters could affect their receptiveness to your charms. If you love mature women, there is plenty to choose from. (pictured Maria) Maria, the hot MILF neighbor with two daughters. Chasing either of her daughters can remind her of what it was like to be young and open opportunities to fulfill her new yearning for intimacy. Victoria, another MILF neighbor. She lived alone until her daughter recently moved back home. Can you rekindle her desires and show her what she's been missing? Teri, the MILF owner of the local Cafe and mother of one of your babysitters (Samantha). Teri doesn't like to admit her age and loves the attention of younger men, regardless of what her daughter or anyone else thinks. And so much more. Each woman has her own desires and passions to fulfill. There are fifteen daughters you can romance in the game. They are split up into two categories. The younger daughter includes Alison, Amy, Caprice, Haylee, Josie, Keira, Kirsten, and Natasha. The older daughters include Catherine, Elena, Karla, Kimberley, Melanie, Patricia, and Samantha. The younger daughters are the same age as Max and attend the same college. Which classes you pick will determine which girls you will see more of. The girls are venturing into adult life like Max, and each has their own expectations. The girls in this group will be more suspicious of you flirting with their mothers. (Pictured Caprice) The older daughters are in the 21-25 age range, with Catherine being the oldest of the group. The girls in this group have already ventured into adult life and have a little more street smarts than their younger counterparts. They are likely to have more responsibilities and life issues and will generally be less suspicious of your flirting with their mothers. (Pictured Catherine) Not all the mother-daughter relationships are revealed straight away. This is designed as a challenge as the characters observe the player and may change their behavior depending on how they see you interacting with other women. Focus on one love interest and maximize your playtime with her. Aim for all her scenes and explore her needs and desires and delve into her backstory as you aim to seduce your one true love. Mothers and Daughters allows you to pursue just the one love interest if this is how you prefer to play. You’ll still have scenes with other characters and will play through other story aspects of the game, but you can do so while remaining faithful to your true love. Why settle for one woman when you can have multiple. Chase several love interests simultaneously and explore the desires of many characters as you choose the ones you want to be with. Mothers and Daughters presents opportunities where you can pursue multiple love interests. Your chosen difficulty setting can make this a real challenge. But be careful who you go after, as women will talk, and you could end up in big trouble. Not content with chasing multiple women separately? Then go for the group option. The harem play style is similar to dating various love interests. But instead of keeping each love interest unaware of the other women you are pursuing, the goal is to get those women into a group where they’re happy to share you with other women and even participate in group sessions. Unlike the multiple women play style, the harem play-through will present options to get a group of women together. Due to the pre-rendered nature of a visual novel, the groupings of women shown for a particular harem will be offered based on community feedback and interests, as well as story needs, as the development continues. First, you’ll need to pursue women separately to get them interested in you. Then through game events, you introduce them to aspects of group dating and sexual interests. Some women will be keener than others to explore group sexual activities with other women. You can use this aspect to maintain smaller groups if you prefer, rather than going for one large group. Your choices, big and small, add depth to your adventure. Mothers and Daughters offers a dynamic storytelling experience where every decision you make, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has its own ripple effect. When Catherine removes her heels, do you say she's shorter than you or that you're taller than her? If she doesn't like being called short, she may bring it up in future conversations to poke fun at you in return. Those smaller choices are designed to make the characters feel alive and more immersive. Also allowing for subtle changes if you replay the game opting for different paths. Not only that but some subtle choices open other scenes. When you first meet Catherine, and she asks for help moving boxes, you can say she looks sweaty. In response, she'll say she will jump in the shower later. Whilst it may seem inconsequential, it opens the chance of spying on her getting changed later that day. Note: This is a long play story first game. If you're looking for a quick fap, this isn't going to meet your needs.

Those smaller choices are designed to make the characters feel alive and more immersive. Also allowing for subtle changes if you replay the game opting for different paths. Not only that but some subtle choices open other scenes. When you first meet Catherine, and she asks for help moving boxes, you can say she looks sweaty. In response, she'll say she will jump in the shower later. Whilst it may seem inconsequential, it opens the chance of spying on her getting changed later that day. Note: This is a long play story first game. If you're looking for a quick fap, this isn't going to meet your needs. ","A contemporary adult visual novel with a diverse cast of love interests and multiple paths to take you on a journey through the story. Will you be led by lust and seduce every woman you meet, or will you win over and pursue that one special woman?",,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2508400/header.jpg?t=1709381259,https://www.spin256.com/,https://www.spin256.com/,,True,True,True,0,,0,0,"Mothers and Daughters is an Adult Visual Novel.

1011130,Life is Pointless,2019-02-04,0,0.99,0,"Earn points by doing that which is pointless. Based on the designer’s own struggle with depression, Life is Pointless takes the player on a cerebral and stoic adventure as they try to escape their meaningless existence. Deep and contemplative, the player is forced to repeatedly complete the same mundane tasks in this minimalist experience, watching as the days pass endlessly before them. More of a philosophical argument than a game, Life is Pointless will force you to take a closer look at your own daily actions, and determine if you, too, are in the pointless pursuit of points. Features include: • Over .01 hours of exciting gameplay! • Absolutely no multiplayer capabilities! • Vivid color palette of black, white, off-white, and dark-grey! • Painstakingly produced over the span of almost an entire week! • Two endlessly looping tracks of music, each an astonishing six seconds long! • Revolutionary day and night cycle! • Incredibly smooth learning curve! • Points! But the best part about Life is Pointless is that you don’t even need to be actively playing the game to earn points! For the truly devoted player who wants to live the game, rather than play it, they can minimize the application, and perform their daily computer routines. Even if the game loses focus, it will still record the number of key presses you enter, slowly adding them to your score. At the end of the day, you can go back into the game, and see just how many points your normally pointless existence has earned you! “Fantastic!” - Made up game reviewer #1 “5 stars!” - Made up game reviewer #2 “The greatest game ever made!” - Will deManbey ( Game Designer, Life is Pointless ) “Better than Car Theft Auto!” - Will deManbey’s Mom Disclaimer: If you haven’t already guessed from the above description, screenshots, and trailers, there isn’t all that much to this game. It was created from a place of twisted darkness in the designer’s soul, and publishing it was just something he decided to do for fun. He was originally going to make it free, but the same twisted darkness thought it would be hilarious to make people pay for it. That being said, do not purchase this “game” if you do not have a sense of humor. If you’re planning on feeling disappointed, and writing a negative review about it later, then you might as well stop right here. This game was built on negativity and disappointment, so the designer has plenty of it already. Additional Disclaimer: Depression is a real and serious matter, and while this is a work of farce and humor, depression should under no circumstances be taken lightly. It is highly advised that those afflicted should seek professional counselling for depression, rather than express your emotional turmoil in isolation.","Earn points by doing that which is pointless.

This game also manages the balance between drama and humor, makes sure that nothing is out of place. Not only you will experience hilarious jokes and references, but also a simple yet well-written story. What makes Fallen Times unique? Fallen Times is set in a parallel universe where our earth is connected with another world, Fancy Moon, a once beautiful fantasy world, has fallen into close-anarchy, due to the policy and imperialism invasion, and became the hotbed of crime and smuggling. The story revolves around two of those criminals, where the player takes the role on Kristfina, a mercenary hired by a drug smuggler, Hanna Rein. You'll experience Kristfina's journey while she explores the meaning of her life, and the relationship between she and her boss, also her best friend, Hanna Rein.

Either peek and pick, gun and run, or just speedrun! Old school style gameplay! There are no regenerating health or arrows that point towards objectives, but well-placed hints and resources.

This game makes sure that you lose not because of the bad design, but your own fault. Enemies make enough indications before attacking, ensuring that the AI doesn't feel like cheating and cheap. Mega Man-style boss fights! All boss fights are short but filled with action sequences instead of being boring bullet sponge. Extra 'boss rush' game mode after you finished the main story mode.

While there are tension-building sequences meant to be unnerving, the game does not depict excessive graphic violence or gore. The storyline explores mature subject matter, including supernatural occurrences and disturbing situations. However, it does not contain any explicit sexual content. There are references to alcohol and drug use in certain contexts. Potentially unsettling topics such as death, mental instability, and psychological trauma are present, but they are portrayed respectfully without gratuitous detail. There may be some jump scares and creepy imagery/environments. Overall, the game maintains a suspenseful and eerie tone rather than relying on shocking visceral content. However, parental guidance is still recommended for younger audiences due to the game's mature thematic elements and unsettling horror overtones throughout the experience.","['Simplified Chinese', 'English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Russian', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Portuguese - Portugal']",[],"[{'title': 'Buy Abnormal1999:The Compass and the Sand', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Abnormal1999: The Compass and the Sand - $2.99', 'description': '', 'price': 2.99}]}]",['QZQ Studio'],['QZQ Studio'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Family Sharing']","['Adventure', 'Indie']","['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_551ab1e10e93e50e9c7cd075ca24c87cac4cffb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_177e5451123787dc90c04173ad2e337eae654a0a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_22fcca5f34aacc747feb2462b8dbd760b8d7f0b9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_3752537d795c17d62071d10e360855def89f78a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_d726acbf67130ac01494b39e6854447a45714d0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_641438dd82811ca1ea347daf3cf210557a0e8351.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_9148cae125582cdad957d447fc7b751eea8d3cde.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_ed4a286c50a3e844424147c039c07a3bd68eb2b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_8e2d95aaaaf5485cc7a6d39d10480e4ca42b48ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_b498f7711706676ea015469135f67762e0f67aa1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_1b2f75c904204fdd066dc8ce14c0f2a4eca995d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_c878ec6855754c0fa535b5449e1dec1fc4c9f0d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_04d29a8af7f792ecaf927c4962735d4903eb154c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_4d2883613eba5c27272c17d492c8032b2503a44b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_6f79e853896185418e5619f3923fe17732e93c69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_46d63382b3667d48224d81640f261ea6962c450d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3146640/ss_a7f953e420ddba160a73ba64c32dd1049065825f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1740583100']",['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/257045420/movie_max.mp4?t=1723437021'],0,,95,1,0 - 20000,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'Adventure': 71, 'Puzzle': 45, 'Choose Your Own Adventure': 42, 'Collectathon': 39, '3D': 36, 'First-Person': 31, 'Third Person': 28, 'Detective': 26, 'Horror': 24, 'Investigation': 22, 'Indie': 20, 'Mystery': 20, 'Nonlinear': 18, 'Story Rich': 16, 'Singleplayer': 14, 'Exploration': 12}",98,88,-1,-1

You were retrieved by the Rebellions and you were given one choice: To help the Rebellions end of the civil war by conquering Pandemonium, the city where the Demon King resides.

Aid the Rebellions and uncover the real truth behind this world. Features Turn-Based RPG Combat: Lead your new group of allies into combat and strategically plan their every move. A combat system that is familiar and loved by jRPG fans. Stat Distribution: Want more HP? Put points into VIT! Want more damage? Put points into STR, DEX, or INT!

2290890,Endless Dark,2024-12-18,0,7.99,1,"A refreshing twist on roguelite and storytelling, Endless Dark is a psychological horror game about the pressures of monotony and the purpose of existence. You, the Custodian, are a sentient machine onboard a sleeper colony ship, charged with keeping it intact. No combat, enemies, or NPCs await you - only a myriad of system failures and the decay of your own sanity as you whittle away the decades in isolation. Hundreds of story events and a deep narrative keep each iteration of you intrigued. Customize your own chassis, repair the ship, and keep your passengers alive long enough to win... something. Can you uncover the intent behind your own creation before you slip into robo-dementia? STORY MODE The ship is shadowy in more ways than one. Ancient agreements and long-forgotten understandings conspire against you to keep you in your place. Doing your work. For however long the long-absent conspirators wanted. Explore a deep narrative that evolves over multiple playthroughs, and choose how you deal with each new revelation. Not all truths will set you free, and some things are better left unsaid. ENDLESS MODE For a more mechanical challenge, try the optional endless mode. In this mode, the only objective is to propel the ship as far as you can before you inevitably lose your passengers, your mind, or both. Contend with the confusing oddities of the ship and its myriad catastrophes with a specially written CRISIS CYCLE. Three impending crises, promising grievous and irreparable damage, will be shown to you. Use your intuition, born of your intimate awareness of your vessel, to discern which two crises are lies, and which one is the true threat! Choose wisely - the Crisis will not be gentle if you fail to prepare for it. PLAYABLE... Endless Dark has been designed from the start to be eminently playable for Custodians with their own histories. The game has a specially chosen color palate to be visible for numerous kinds of colorblindness, even full monochromacy. Large, clear text makes messages readable at a glance. All Custodians need only bring their willingness to do, explore, and grow. Busy Custodians also need not fear; distinct, bite-sized turns with effortless autosave allows for drop-in, drop-out play. Control things your way; the game is fully playable with a gamepad only, keyboard only, or mouse and keyboard. ...AND REPLAYABLE With over 350,000 words of events, spread over dozens of dilemmas, and a finely tuned Director that applies just the right amount of pressure, Endless Dark is designed to never present the same situation twice. Fight and overcome, or struggle and succumb, the next time will always be different - especially due to your own actions. Your tiniest victories and littlest defeats alike are recorded and remembered. They will remain in subsequent games, to help or haunt you.

Three impending crises, promising grievous and irreparable damage, will be shown to you. Use your intuition, born of your intimate awareness of your vessel, to discern which two crises are lies, and which one is the true threat! Choose wisely - the Crisis will not be gentle if you fail to prepare for it. PLAYABLE... Endless Dark has been designed from the start to be eminently playable for Custodians with their own histories. The game has a specially chosen color palate to be visible for numerous kinds of colorblindness, even full monochromacy. Large, clear text makes messages readable at a glance. All Custodians need only bring their willingness to do, explore, and grow. Busy Custodians also need not fear; distinct, bite-sized turns with effortless autosave allows for drop-in, drop-out play. Control things your way; the game is fully playable with a gamepad only, keyboard only, or mouse and keyboard. ...AND REPLAYABLE With over 350,000 words of events, spread over dozens of dilemmas, and a finely tuned Director that applies just the right amount of pressure, Endless Dark is designed to never present the same situation twice. Fight and overcome, or struggle and succumb, the next time will always be different - especially due to your own actions. Your tiniest victories and littlest defeats alike are recorded and remembered. They will remain in subsequent games, to help or haunt you. ","An existential horror game in which you are tasked with keeping a sleeper colony ship intact. No enemies or NPCs share the ship with you - only creaking metal echoes and endless dark. Overcome random events, system failures, and the downward spiral of your sanity to see your mission through.",,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2290890/header.jpg?t=1734587999,,https://www.reddit.com/r/endlessdark/,endlessdarkgame@gmail.com,True,False,True,0,,25,0,Depictions of psychosis and mental illness.
